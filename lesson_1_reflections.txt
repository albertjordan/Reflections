learning about git

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

If files are large, you need a tool that will pin point the changes made, and it is easier to find the problem.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is used for code changes, and for code changes it makes sense to allow for allow changes to multiple files at once.  Google Docs handles individual files, and tracking changes to multiple files at once is less relevent

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log is all you need.. most recent one on top....
Git diff does between two commmit id..

note , i had to revert back to ge this to work


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

you can always go back and get to the point where the bug was not introduced
