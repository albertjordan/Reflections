this is the reflections file for the 3rd lesson created on Git Hub


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you don't want to over write changes you have made to your local directory....


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


Fork is similar to a clone, except it happens on git hub.  

clone gets a specific branch and replicates on the target directory

Branch is creating a new path where you can experiment on things or add new features.
